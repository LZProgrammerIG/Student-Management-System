# Student-Management-System
A Python menu driven project which stores data of students in My SQL.

The user can enter the records of students and store them in a database called Sqlite3 which is in an essence the online version of My SQL database. The program also allows user various operations to the database like modification, addition, deletion etc.


## Warning
This project was created on Google Colab and hence may not work properly when run locally on the machine. Also this project stores the database file in Google Drive. Hence it is recommended to run the Python script in Google Colab only.
